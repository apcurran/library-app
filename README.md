Creating a book list program using JavaScript objects and some basic OOP

Features:
-Adding of any book (includes inputs for title, author, number of pages, and finished/unfinished)
-Removal of any book with a delete button
-Status (read/not read) can be toggled at any time with a button click

This project was fun and challenging! I felt it was a great opportunity to practice DOM manipulation, creation of elements, conditionals, loops, objects, and many other fundamental JavaScript principles!
