Creating a book list program using JavaScript objects

Project [link](https://apcurran.github.io/library-app/)

Features:

-Add any book (includes inputs for title, author, number of pages, and finished/unfinished).

-Remove any book with a delete button.

-Status (read/not read) can be toggled at any time with a button click.

-Mobile-friendly layout

-Uses local storage for persistence

This project was fun and challenging! I felt it was a great opportunity to practice DOM manipulation, creation of elements, conditionals, loops, objects, and many other fundamental JavaScript principles!
